# Nova Front-End challenge
First things first: create a GitHub repo and invite the GitHub users `loeklj, eldarshamukhamedov, julesterrien` to collaborate (make sure they have write access). Upload this starter-code to that repo and branch off master. This branch will be your working branch.

### Submitting
